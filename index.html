    <h1>Mosiah 4</h1>
    <h3>10 And again, believe that ye must repent of your sins and forsake them, and humble yourselves before God; and ask in sincerity of heart that he would forgive you; and now, if you believe all these things see that ye do them. <br>
        11 And again I say unto you as I have said before, that as ye have come to the knowledge of the glory of God, or if ye have known of his goodness and have tasted of his love, and have received a remission of your sins, which causeth such exceedingly great joy in your souls, even so I would that ye should remember, and always retain in remembrance, the greatness of God, and your own nothingness, and his goodness and long-suffering towards you, unworthy creatures, and humble yourselves even in the depths of humility, calling on the name of the Lord daily, and standing steadfastly in the faith of that which is to come, which was spoken by the mouth of the angel. <br>
        
        12 And behold, I say unto you that if ye do this ye shall always rejoice, and be filled with the love of God, and always retain a remission of your sins; and ye shall grow in the knowledge of the glory of him that created you, or in the knowledge of that which is just and true.</h3>

        <p>In Verse 10, Mosiah asks us to repent in prayer, and ask for forgiveness with sincerity of heart. I repented for my dirty habits, including pornography, and any other form of entertainment. In my eyes, video games, youtube videos, and celebrities are all forms of dirty habits, and I truly was able to repent sincerely, without impurities in mind or heart, regarding my repentance. As I prayed for forgiveness, I truly started to believe my repentance. "If you believe all these things..." I do believe. I believe that I was ashamed, and repentful. So, my heart and mind lifted in my prayer. I felt voices of angels shouting praises in my heart.<br>

            Verse 11 speaks of humility, and the character of Heavenly Father. Pray daily. <br>
            
            Verse 12 speaks of promise. Do this daily, and you will always be cheerful. You will always know the love of God. You will always feel the way I felt when I believed my repentance, which was freeing, which was the rejoicing voice of angels in my heart.</p>
